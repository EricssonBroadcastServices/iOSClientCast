## Features


## Requirements

* `iOS` 9.0+
* `Swift` 4.0+
* `Xcode` 9.0+

* Framework dependencies
    - [`GoogleCast`](https://developers.google.com/cast/) v4.0.2
    
* Streams:
    - `DASH`/`CENC` (as required by the *EMP receiver*)

## Installation

### Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependency graph without interfering with your `Xcode` project setup. `CI` integration through [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) is also available.

Install *Carthage* through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by performing the following commands:

```sh
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Once *Carthage* has been installed, you need to create a `Cartfile` which specifies your dependencies. Please consult the [artifacts](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md) documentation for in-depth information about `Cartfile`s and the other artifacts created by *Carthage*.

```sh
github "EricssonBroadcastServices/iOSClientCast"
```

Running `carthage update` will fetch your dependencies and place them in `/Carthage/Checkouts`. You either build the `.framework`s and drag them in your `Xcode` or attach the fetched projects to your `Xcode workspace`.

Finally, make sure you add the `.framework`s to your targets *General -> Embedded Binaries* section.

## Usage
`Cast` simplifies integration with the *EMP* `ChromeCast` `Receiver` by delivering a set of specialized extensions to the `GoogleCast` library.

### Getting Started
*EMP ChromeCast layer*, `Cast` extends the default `GoogleCast` framework to work with the *EMP ChromeCast Receiver* and is fully compliant with the default version unless otherwise stated. The framework is not intended to be a replacement for *Google*s implementaion. Please have a look at the [`EMP ChromeCast Receiver`](#https://github.com/EricssonBroadcastServices/html5-player/blob/master/sdk/tutorials/chromecast-receiver.md) and [sender apps](#https://github.com/EricssonBroadcastServices/html5-player/blob/master/sdk/tutorials/chromecast.md) in general for in depth documentation.

`Cast` does not alter the general *ChromeCast* workflow as described by [`Google`](#https://developers.google.com/cast/) in any significant way.

### Loading Media
Loading media onto the *receiver* requires *client applications* to supply several things. First of all, a valid `SessionToken` and an *Exposure* `Environment` is required as the *receiver* will perform an entitlements request prior to starting playback. Secondly, media identifiers in the form of *EMP asset Id* (and optionally a program id) for the asset in question.

```Swift
let environment = Environment(baseUrl: exposureBaseUrl,
                              customer: "someCustomer",
                              businessUnit: "someBusinessUnit",
                              sessionToken: validSessionToken)
                              
let assetId = "amazingAsset"
```

Finally, each load request may be complimented with `CustomData` that issues special instructions to the *receiver*.

```Swift
let customData = CustomData(environment: environment,
                            assetId: assetId,
                            useLastViewedOffset: true)
```

These include, but are not limited to:
* Audio and text language
* Start time manipulation
* Timeshift override
* Maximum bitrate selection
* Autoplay behavior
* Session shift configuration

The actual loading of the configured media is done through *API*s provided by *Google*. Media metadata can also be set during this process but is not described here. Please consult the *Google* [docmentation](#https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/ios_sender_setup) for more information.

```Swift
let mediaInfo = GCKMediaInformation(contentID: assetId,
                                    streamType: .none,
                                    contentType: "video/mp4",
                                    metadata: metaData,
                                    streamDuration: 0,
                                    mediaTracks: nil,
                                    textTrackStyle: nil,
                                    customData: nil)

let mediaLoadOptions = GCKMediaLoadOptions()

// Provide the custom data to the receiver.
mediaLoadOptions.customData = customData.toJson

GCKCastContext
    .sharedInstance()
    .sessionManager
    .currentCastSession
    .remoteMediaClient?
    .loadMedia(mediaInfo, with: mediaLoadOptions)
```

### Responding to Events
The *EMP Receiver* has been customized to publish several non-standard events. These can be listened to through by creating, registering and then observing `Channel`s.

A `Channel` is an `Cast` specific extension of the *Google* provided `GCKCastChannel` and governs the *sender*-to-*receiver* communication.


Embedded tracks are broadcasted to all connected senders when the tracks or the period change. *Client applications* should listen to the `onTracksUpdated` message and update *UI* accordingly.

```Swift
let channel = Channel()

channel.onTracksUpdated { tracksUpdated in
    // Update UI
}
```

`tracksUpdated` contains information about subtiles and audio along with information about the currently active track(s). Selecting a different track can be done by supplying the `Channel` with a `Track` struct.

```Swift
let englishSubs = tracksUpdated
    .subtitles
    .filter{ $0.language == "en" }
    .first

if let subs = englishSubs {
    channel.use(textTrack: subs)
}
```

Or by specifying the *2 letter code* for the desired language.

```Swift
channel.use(subtitle: "en")
```

The same proceedure applies for audio tracks.

Finally, it is possible to hide the subtitle track.

```Swift
channel.hideSubtitles()
```

A user who joins a session in progress may wish to receive updated status of the *ChromeCast* controls. This can be done by calling `refreshControls()` which will force an `onTracksUpdated` event.

```Swift
channel.refreshControls()
```

There is also several general information events detailing how the stream in question behaves. `onTimeshiftEnabled` for example indicates if timeline UI should be present or not.

```Swift
channel
    .onTimeshiftEnabled { timeshift in
        // Hide or show timeline in UI
    }
    .onVolumeChanged { volumeChanged in
        // Update the volume indicator
    }
    .onAutoplay { autoplay in
        // Indicates if playback during the cast session was started automatically
    }
```

The following methods declare event listeners that may be especially useful for managing *live* playback.

```Swift
channel
    .onDurationChanged { duration in
        // Signaled repeatedly while a media grows.
    }
    .onStartTimeLive{ startTime in
        // Indicates the start time in *unix epoch* time for the current live stream.
    }
    .onProgramChanged{ program in
        // The program changed, update relevant media metadata
    }
    .onIsLive { isLive in
        // Update "live now" indicators
    }
```

### Error Handling
Two event listeners declare events related to error handling. The first, `onSegmentMissing`, publishes information about seek cancellation due to missing segments. It can be useful to give users feedback when their intended seek failed.
Beyond that, errors will be broadcasted through the `onError` event.

```Swift
channel
    .onSegmentMissing{ segment in
        // Indicate the seek was cancelled due to missing segments
    }
    .onError{ error in
        // Handle or display the error in question
    }
```

Error handling revolves around three types of errors, `ReceiverError`, `SenderError` and `GCKError`. The former two are defined by `Cast` and the last one provided by *Google*.

`SenderError`s mostly deal with serialization and message translation stemming from the *sender*-to-*receiver* communication. Errors in this domain indicate issues with either the `Cast` framework or it's integration with the *EMP receiver*.

`ReceiverError`s come direcly from the *EMP receiver*. For more information with regards to debugging the receiver, please look at this [documentation](#https://github.com/EricssonBroadcastServices/html5-player/tree/master/sdk/tutorials).
Each `ReceiverError` has an associated `code` and `message`.

Finally, `GCKError` stem from `GoogleCast` framework. More information can be found [here](#https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/debugging)

## Release Notes
Release specific changes can be found in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/EricssonBroadcastServices/iOSClientCast/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Upgrade Guides
The procedure to apply when upgrading from one version to another depends on what solution your client application has chosen to integrate `Exposure`.

Major changes between releases will be documented with special [Upgrade Guides](https://github.com/EricssonBroadcastServices/iOSClientCast/blob/master/UPGRADE_GUIDE.md).

### Carthage
Updating your dependencies is done by running  `carthage update` with the relevant *options*, such as `--use-submodules`, depending on your project setup. For more information regarding dependency management with `Carthage` please consult their [documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md) or run `carthage help`.

## Roadmap
No formalised roadmap has yet been established but an extensive backlog of possible items exist. The following represent an unordered *wish list* and is subject to change.

- [ ] Deep integration with `Exposure` through specialized extensions.
